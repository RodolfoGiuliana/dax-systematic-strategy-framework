# dax-systematic-strategy-framework
Institutional-grade analysis framework for systematic trading strategies on the DAX index, including Monte Carlo risk simulations and regime-based performance evaluation

This repository presents an institutional-grade analytical framework designed to evaluate systematic trading strategies applied to the DAX index (GERMANY 40).

The project is built around real backtest data exported focuses on robust performance validation, risk decomposition, and probabilistic outcome analysis.

Key objectives include:

Independent validation of strategy robustness

Quantification of tail risk and drawdown behavior

Monte Carlo simulation of equity paths

Regime-aware performance attribution

The framework is intended for quantitative researchers, portfolio managers, and systematic traders seeking professional-grade post-trade analytics rather than signal generation.
