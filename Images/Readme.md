# DAX Monte Carlo Simulation Results

This repository showcases the outcomes of Monte Carlo simulations applied to the DAX index. Only the final results are shared as images (PNG), without exposing the underlying data or scripts.

## Methodology

- Monte Carlo simulations were run to model potential DAX index paths.
- Random sampling techniques were used to simulate multiple trajectories.
- The results are visualized as charts showing projected index behavior and volatility.

## Images

All the simulation charts are stored in the `images/` folder.

-  Example of a single simulation path.
-  Distribution of multiple simulation outcomes.
-  Additional charts demonstrating variations.

## Notes

- Data used for these simulations is confidential and not included.
- This repository is for visualization and demonstration purposes only.
